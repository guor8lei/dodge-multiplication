# Dodge Multiplication Game

This was a simple game I coded in Java as a side project in high school. The object of the game is to dodge different color lasers, collecting the color that represents the answer to the multiplication question displayed at the top of the screen which changes every 5 seconds.

## Running the Game

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/guor8lei/dodge-multiplication.git`
2. Open up Eclipse (or preferred IDE)
3. (Eclipse only) Click on `File >> Import`
4. (Eclipse only) Click on `Git >> Projects from Git >> Next >> Existing local repository >> Next >> Add`
5. (Eclipse only) For the Directory field, click `Browse` and select the `dodge-multiplication` folder that you just cloned
6. (Eclipse only) Check the checkbox and click `Finish`
7. (Eclipse only) Click `Next >> Finish`
